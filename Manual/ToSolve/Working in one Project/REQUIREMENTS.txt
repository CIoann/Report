Implement inheritance hierarchy of classes derive from a 
DessertItem abstract superclass

Candy, Cookie, IceCream classes will be derived from DessertItem class

The Sundae class will derive from IceCream class


The Candy class should be derived from the DessertItem class. 
A Candy item has a weight and a price per pound which are used to 
 determine its cost. 
 For example, 2.30 lbs.of fudge @ .89 /lb. = 205 cents. 
 The cost should be rounded to the nearest cent.

The Cookie class should be derived from the DessertItem class. 
A Cookie item has a number and a price per dozen which are used to 
determine its cost. 
For example, 4 cookies @ 399 cents /dz. = 133 cents. 
The cost should be rounded to the nearest cent.

The IceCream class should be derived from the DessertItem class. 
An IceCream item simply has a cost.


The Sundae class should be derived from the IceCream class. 
The cost of a Sundae is the cost of the IceCream plus
the cost of the topping.
