\vspace{-15mm}
This thesis was carried out at the department of DTU Compute, at the Technical University of Denmark, in fulfilment of the requirements for acquiring an M.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering.
The goal of this project was to collect data on how developers interact with the IDE while developing software and to mine developers' workflows from IDE usage using process mining techniques. 
%The research for the thesis project was inspired from Barbara Weber and the her own work in ideas of congition.
This thesis project was an extention of a previous plugin of eclipse called Rabbit, which is a metric tool for user interaction with the IDE of Eclipse. 

This report describes the project itself, discusses the concepts involved, describes in detail the software that was used and developed during this project, and
presents the results of mining developers' interactions with the IDE of Eclipse.%of a case study +process mining}
