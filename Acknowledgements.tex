\chapter{Acknowledgements}

My deepest thanks go to my advisor, Barbara Weber. Throughout these months, Barbara gave me the freedom for exploring an unkown field, challenged my findings, and offered advices whenever needed. Barbara taught me the importance of software methodologies and helped me to evolve my experience with agile environments: by narrowing down ideas and being selective over the most feasible ones. All these advices have been invaluable. 
I also thank my co-supervisor Andrea Burattin for his time and feedback. Andrea shared his knowledge regarding process mining and his questions and suggestions have enabled me to view this work from a wider perspective.
Furthermore I would like to express my gratitude to my family and friends who showed patience and were supportive during moments of frustrations.

A great thank you to everyone who believed in me!
